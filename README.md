## About the Project

The main purpose of this data is to explore the pollution data and understand the insights, the risk factors and deaths related to that.

Per Wikipedia `Air pollution is the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials. There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane, carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution may cause diseases, allergies and even death to humans; it may also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain). Both human activity and natural processes can generate air pollution

In the analysis we conclude: There are countries that are more improving than others, the main ones that are improving are western countries while the countries that are getting worse in the last 27 years in terms of Air Pollution are mainly in the middle east and Africa, I think these countries should focus more on improving the Air Quality, we know also the Middle East is a large hub of oil and gas, so maybe that's one the main factors of the air quality.

## I obtained the data from [Kaggle here](https://www.kaggle.com/pavan9065/air-pollution-analysis)
